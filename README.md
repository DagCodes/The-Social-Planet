# The-Social-Planet
Impact of Geographic location on Social Networks. The idea of the project is to analyze the effect of location on the network between people from all over the world by targeting the travel history of social media users and their connections. The users would be able to see how the network changes over time, travel patterns of people, possible changes in popularity over time and many more. This visualization would be useful for users like social media analysts, influencer agencies, and companies who want to maximize their social media reach.
